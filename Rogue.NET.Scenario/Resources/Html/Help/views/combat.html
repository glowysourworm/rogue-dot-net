		<h3>Combat Turns</h3>
		<p>
			The number of combat turns you're allowed is determined by the ratio of your agility to your enemy's agility. For example:  If your agility is 5 and your enemy's is 3 then for every 5 turns you get your enemy will only be allowed 3. 
		</p>
	</div>

		<h3>Basic Melee</h3>
		<p>
			As described in the <a href="#/navigation">Navigation</a> section you can attack an enemy by using CTRL + [Direction Key]. Your attack value as shown in your <a href="#/intro">statistics panel</a> is the highest number of hitpoints worth of damage you can inflict during an attack - except for a critical hit which is 2x this value. 
		</p>
		<p>
			During a melee round your attack value is calculated uniformly from 0 to your max value; and your enemy's defense value will be subtracted from this number. The result is the number of hit points that will be subtracted from the defender (you or your enemy).
		</p>
		<p>
			Also during a melee round there is a chance that the attacker's hit could be a critical hit or that the defender could dodge the attack. These are determined by the critical hit statistic and dodge statistic.
		</p>
	</div>

		<h3>Hit Points (HP)</h3>
		<p>
			You just got in a fight with a Krill and your HP meter is low! What do you do?! Different scenarios will allow you their own way to recharge your HP. Many have Healing Wells that you can use or Healing Potions. Your HP will recharge naturally (but slowly!) according to your HP Regen value seen in your <a href="#/intro">statistics panel</a>. Part of the fun of each Scenario is to figure out how to manage your resources to get through to the end - so have fun! Some Scenarios can be like a puzzle!
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h3>Ranged Combat</h3>
		<p>
			Some weapons are ranged - requiring at least 2 spaces between you and your targeted enemy. To use these you must have ammunition in your inventory that corresponds to the range weapon you have equipped. You can view the ammunition type for each weapon in the <a href="#/intro">Encyclopedia Rogue-Tanica</a>. Ammunition is one use only. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The attack value for range weapons is calculated based on the weapon's quality and your agility. The ammunition does not contribute to the attack value. However, ammunition can carry a spell that is activated when it reaches the enemy. For example, an exploding arrow or rock for a sling.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, there are consumable items that you can use by throwing them. This is as seen in the <a href="#/intro">Introduction</a> section. 
		</p>
		<div class="highlight-box">
			<h5>To Fire a Range Weapon:</h5> Use the [Target Key] to first target your enemy. Then use the [Fire Key] to fire your weapon. Both of these are configurable in the <a href="#/intro">Command Preferences</a> menu. By default the [Target Key] is "T" and the [Fire Key] is "F".
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h3>Spell Combat</h3>
		<p>
			There are a great many types of spells that can contribute to a combat scenario. These include: projectile spells; aura spells; statistic altering spells; etc... As an example of a projectile spell - your player could be equipped with a skill called "Fire". (For more information about skills see the <a href="#/skills">Skills</a> section) You first activate this skill using the <a href="#/intro">skill panel</a>. Then, you target an enemy using the [Target Key]. Finally you use your [Skill Key] to invoke "Fire".
		</p>
		<div class="highlight-box">
			<h5>To Use a Skill on a Targeted Enemy:</h5> Use the [Skill Key] which is configured in the <a href="#/intro">Command Preferences</a> menu. The default [Skill Key] is "X".
		</div>
		<p>
			There are a great many different spells in Rogue.NET since they are at the core of each skill, item effect, weapon effect, and dungeon object effect. It's highly recommended that you read the <a href="#/skills">Skills</a> section for more information.
		</p>
		<p>
			When a spell is used an enemy or your player may block the spell based on their <a href="#/intro">Magic Block statistic</a>.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h3>Magic Points (MP)</h3>
		<p>
			All of that spell usage is leaving your character short on MP! Not to worry - there are a great many ways in each scenario that MP can be restored. Most scenarios have Mana Wells or Mana Potions that restore MP. Also, it is restored naturally according to your player's <a href="#/intro">MP Regen statistic</a>.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h3>Attack Attributes</h3>
		<p>
			On top of your player's <a href="#/intro">Attack statistic</a> items, enemies, and spells can also carry Attack Attributes. These are types of attacks that contribute to the total attack value. They're different for each Scenario; but can include: Sharp; Blunt; Piercing; Fire; Cold; Light; Dark; etc... Each attribute has an attack; weakness; and resistance value. 
		</p>
		<p>
			An attack attribute calculation goes as follows. The calculated value is a function of the attack A, weakness W, and resistance R values:  F(A,R,W) = A[1 - (R / A + R)] + AW
		</p>
		<p>
			This allows items to have a huge impact on an enemy. For example: You're fighting a troll that has 20 Strength; but a weakness to Piercing (Attack Attribute) of 3. If you have a sword that has Piercing Attack of 10, that's at least 30 damage due to the Attack Attribute contribution to the melee. 
		</p>
		<div class="highlight-box">
			<h5>Attack Attributes are Hugely Imporant!</h5> Be sure to look at your player's <a href="#/intro">Equipment Display</a> and see what attack attribute values you have. Also, check the <a href="#/intro">Encyclopedia Rogue-Tanica</a> for hints about what attributes an enemy has a weakness to! There is also a <a href="#/intro">Gadget</a> that allows you to see your enemy's statistics and attack attributes. Be sure to use it if you're lucky enough to find it!
		</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h3>Tactics!</h3>
		<p>
			Each Scenario is designed to challenge you to manage resources, build your player's skills, and utilize dungeon objects in order to defeat or out-wit your enemies. If you hit a rough spot - DON'T BE DISCOURAGED! Sometimes items will have attack attributes that will be the key to defeating other enemies; or just passing one level will enable a new skill that will save your hide! Keep trying and don't give up! Use your food wisely!
