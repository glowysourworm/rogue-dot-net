		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			As far as we know here at the Rogue.NET project - this is the world's first <a href="#/intro">rogue like</a> whose goal is to share user built games online. The games - or Scenarios - we've constructed using a custom editor that we're also including with the game itself. This will allow you to create Scenarios of your own design and upload them to share with the online community to play and rate.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h3>Scenarios</h3>
		<p>
			Each Scenario consists of: a Rogue class - defined with skills, attributes, and starting inventory; Enemies (the beautifully rendered UTF-8 character set); Dungeon Objects (ranging from Teleporters to Healing Wells to Ritual Beds to anything you can dream up); Level Layouts (with built in configurable support for different constructions); Many wonderous items; and an Objective.
		</p>
		<p>
			Starting out, your Rogue will have a pre-determined set of skills and equipment with which to complete the Scenario Objective. This could be anything from collecting a special item to defeating a unique enemy to using a special dungeon object. Once the objective for the scenario is complete you may exit the dungeon and view / upload your statistics to our server. (For more on this see <a href="#/community">the community section</a>)

		<h3>Basic Gameplay</h3>
		<p>
			A brief introduction screen for your Scenario is given before you're plunged into the depths and left to your own devices. To start, you'll want to equip your player; but first, lets review the user controls.
		</p>
		<img src="content/game-view.png" />
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<p>
			To the top left of the screen you'll see your player's vital statistics:  HP (hit points); MP (magic points); Hunger; Experience; and Haul. Hunger is abated by eating food - which can be found as a consumable item. Experience is gained by defeating enemies; and Haul is the total sum of the weight of your inventory. Once your maximum Haul is reached you won't be able to pick up any more items. Beneath that you'll see a space where your Active Skill is displayed. You're allowed to have one active skill at a time to invoke in combat.
		</p>
		<img src="content/status-panel.png" />
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<p>
			Beneath your player's vital stats is another panel that contains a carousel of useful controls. The first of these is a panel displaying your consumable items. This is only PART of your inventory - and you can use this panel to consume, throw, or drop any of these items. The columns in the list are (from left to right): the item's image; the quantity; the total weight; and the name. 
		</p>
		<div class="highlight-box">
			<h5>To Consume an Item:</h5> Navigate to the consumable panel beneath your player's statistics; click on the potion button towards the bottom; click on the button of the item you wish to consume.
		</div>
		<div class="highlight-box">
			<h5>To Throw an Item:</h5> (WITH AN ENEMY TARGETED) Navigate to the consumable panel beneath your player's statistics; click on the throw button towards the bottom; click on the button of the consumable item you wish to throw. NOTE** Not all items are throwable. Once an item is thrown you cannot collect it again!
		</div>
		<div class="highlight-box">
			<h5>To Drop an Item:</h5> Navigate to the consumable panel beneath your player's statistics; click on the X button towards the bottom; click on the button of the consumable item you wish to drop. NOTE** some items may be stacked if you have more than one of them. Only one will be dropped.
		</div>
		<img src="content/player-subpanel-consumables.png" />		
	</div>	
	<div class="section">
		<p>
			Your inventory consists of consumables and equipment. The second panel in the carousel displays your entire inventory - item for item; and a button beneath the list you can use to drop an item.
		</p>
		<div class="highlight-box">
			<h5>To Drop an Item:</h5> Navigate to the Inventory panel beneath your player's statistics; click on the X button towards the 	bottom; click on the button of the item you wish to drop. Dropped items appear next to your character on the ground.
		</div>
		<img src="content/player-subpanel-inventory.png" />
	</div>	
	<div class="section">
		<p>
			The next panel in the carousel contains a list of your player's skills. Each skill is learned at a particular player level. If a skill is not yet learned it will appear greyed out as "Regenerate" is in the picture to the right. Once a skill is learned you may activate it and also emphasize mastery of the skill using the small arrow buttons to the right of the skill name. For more information see <a href="#/skills">the Skills section</a>.
		</p>		
		<div class="highlight-box">
			<h5>To Activate a Skill:</h5> Navigate to the Skills panel and click the radio button on the right side of the skill you wish to activate.
		</div>
		<img src="content/player-subpanel-skills.png" />
	</div>		
	<div class="section">
		<p>
			Finally, there is a detailed panel to show your player's statistics. The following is a list of those along with their description:
		</p>
		<table>
			<colgroup>
				<col width="300px" />
			</colgroup>
			<tr>
				<td><h4>Strength (Base Statistic)</h4></td>
				<td><p>Used as a base measure for melee attacks, melee blocks, and HP regeneration.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><h4>Agility (Base Statistic)</h4></td>
				<td><p>Used as a base measure for range attacks, melee dodging, and combat turn ratio. (for more information see <a href="#/combat">Combat</a></p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><h4>Intelligence (Base Statistic)</h4></td>
				<td><p>Used as a base measure for MP regeneration, and magic blocking.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><h4>Hp Regen</h4></td>
				<td><p>Number of Hit Points (HP) that are regenerated per turn.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><h4>MP Regen</h4></td>
				<td><p>Number of Magic Points (MP) that are regenerated per turn.</p></td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
				<td><h4>Food Usage</h4></td>
				<td><p>Determines food consumption per turn.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><h4>Aura</h4></td>
				<td><p>Range (in cells) around your player that is visible.</p></td>
			</tr>			
			<tr>
				<td><h4>Attack</h4></td>
				<td><p>This is the combined attack value for your player. It includes contributions from Strength, equipment being worn, spells, auras, and skills.</p></td>
			</tr>		
			<tr>
				<td><h4>Defense</h4></td>
				<td><p>This is the combined defense value for your player. It includes contributions from Strength, equipment being worn, spells, auras, and skills.</p></td>
			</tr>			
			<tr>
				<td><h4>Critical Hit</h4></td>
				<td><p>The critical hit (2x Attack Roll) ratio for your player.</p></td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
				<td><h4>Magic Block</h4></td>
				<td><p>This is the calculated probability of your player's ability to block enemy spells.</p></td>
			</tr>								
			<tr>
				<td><h4>Dodge</h4></td>
				<td><p>This is the calculated probability of your player's ability to dodge enemy attacks.</p></td>
			</tr>											
		</table>
		<p>
			If one of your player's statistics is affected by equipment worn, active spells, enemy spells, etc... it's name will appear either in green or red. Green indicates a positive effect and red indicates a negative effect. By default Food Usage appears in red since it's value always negatively impacts your player.

			The panel to the top left of the screen contains 4 buttons: The command preferences; the Help reference manual (this manual); An objective summary; and a button to exit the scenario.
		</p>
		<img src="content/top-button-panel.png" />

	<div class="section">

			Below the 4 buttons on the top right is the Gadget Panel. There are unique items in Rogue.NET called "Gadgets" that trigger special in game functions. For example: the "Compass Gadget" allows you to see a radar of items, enemies, and dungeon objects such as stair wells and save poitns. You can equip up to 3 gadgets at one time; and new ones may be added to later versions of Rogue.NET.

			Using the arrow buttons on the bottom left and right corners of the screen, you can navigate to two other displays. The first to the right is the equipment display. Here you can see a detailed view of your player's equipment inventory. The grid to the right functions as the other inventory grids allowing you to equip and un-equip items. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<h5>To Equip an Item:</h5>Click on the button towards the bottom of the right panel that looks like a suit of armor. Buttons will appear on the grid next to equipment items that your player can equip.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="#/combat">Attack Attributes</a> are also visible here inside the left panel to the right of the large smiley face. These are calculated based on your player's equipement inventory that modifies them. See the <a href="#/combat">Combat</a> section for more details.
		</p>

	<div class="section">
		<p>
			The other display you can access using the arrow buttons on the bottom is the Encyclopedia Rogue-Tanica. This displays meta data about the items and objects in the dungeon. If an item has been identified you will be able to view it's description and attributes. Otherwise, you'll see a "?" placeholder. Use the panel to the left to cycle through object types; and the one to the right to cycle through entries for that type. You can also see your progress % in the top left panel. Items that are unique or objective items will show with a different border color.
