		<h3>Moving Around</h3>
		<p>
			To move your player around the map use a [Direction Key]. These can be configured (also required if you're starting out using a non-US keyboard layout) using the <a href="#/intro">Command Preferences</a> menu. For a US keyboard, the direction keys are centered by default around the "L" key like the arrows of a compass with "O" being equivalent to "North".
