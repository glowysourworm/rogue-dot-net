		<h3>Skills Define your Character</h3>
		<p>
			Each Scenario defines essentially defines your character class. You can chose to develop your character in different ways during the Scenario; but you're given the same base set of statistics, skills, and items to start off with. This differs from other rogue-likes that allow you to chose different characters to defeat a dungeon with. We're hoping to use this strategy to make the focus more on figuring out how to solve the Scenario with the resrouces you're given.

		<h3>Skill Panel Revisited</h3>
		<p>
			Your <a href="#/intro">Skill Panel</a> allows you to keep track of an manage your player's skills. Your player starts with a pre-determined skill set; but can also learn skills along the way from special items. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Part of solving each Scenario requires that you develop and master your player's skills. To do this you must emphasize skill growth for the skill you want to master. Each skill will have one or more levels of mastery displayed on the left side of the panel. You can emphasize skill mastery using the arrow buttons on the skill item inside the grid.

		<h3>Skill Mastery</h3>
		<p>	
			Leveling up your skills requires careful resource management. You will gain mastery points each time you defeat an enemy with an emphasized skill. The number of mastery points depends on the level of emphasis but NOT on the experience given by the enemy. 
		</p>
		<div class="highlight-box">
			<h5>Skill Mastery Requires Food:</h5> It's important to decide if a skill is worth mastering so that you can allocate your food resources accordingly. Some skills are a must for beating the Scenario and some are not. Monitor your food usage as you attempt to master new skills!

		<h3>Spell Effects</h3>
		<p>
			Spells are a type of Skill in Rogue.NET. Almost everything that has an "effect" is based on a spell - this was done so that all item, dungeon objects, enemy, and player "effects" could be built using a common editor. As a result, there are a great many spell types that needed to be supported by the Rogue.NET game engine. Here is a list of possible effects.

		<h3>Altered States / Remedies</h3>
		<p>
			Your character can encounter altered states that can lead to troublesome situations. For example, permanent blindness at the wrong spot in the scenario can spell disaster for your player. In this situation you'll want to know about remedies. These are items that cure your character's ailments - changing their state back to normal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Scenario builders have to make it obvious what states their remedies cure. For example, a poison remedy should be marked as such in the name of the item. For more information on scenario building see the Scenario Builder's Guide inside the Scenario Editor. NOTE** The Scenario Editor must be unlocked before it can be used. To unlock it you must beat each of the built in scenarios first.

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>
			As you can see the types of spells possible that are supported by the Rogue.NET engine are a great many. It is ultimately up to the Scenario Builder to make sure they include enough hints so that you know what is happening. We've tried to be exhaustive at including hints for the built in scenarios. However, your feedback is always appreciated! Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions regarding the content here. Sometimes we overlook design flaws or areas that aren't described in enough detail to make them accessible for everyone.
