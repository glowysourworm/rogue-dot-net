Hellooo!

If you're reading this - then you've decided to be an extremely awesome human being and 
join the Rogue.NET project! Congratulations!!!

The first order of business is to make sure that you own a copy of VS2012 or later. Also,
let me know and I'll add you as a user to the repository.

After you've got that taken care of:

1) Download the latest version of TortoiseHG
2) Open a command prompt
3) Create a folder for your local repository
4) Run the following commands in your repository folder

hg init
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/glowysourworm/rogue-dot-net

(you'll be prompted for your user credentials)

This will download the repository which you can now view from the TortoiseHG Workbench.

Making commits from here on I'd appreciate if you do from your own branch. To do this let
me know and we'll create a separate branch for you.

Cheers!
~Rogue.NET Project
