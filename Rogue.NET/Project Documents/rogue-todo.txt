- Attack Attributes - Use the flame sword symbol as a global symbol - replace the one in the item grid to show that there's several attributes. (TBD)
- Outro Display (I Won! - Here's my stats!) (STATS TBD)
- Statistics Display (High Scores) (TBD)
- Reveal Image Transparency (TBD)
- Dialog message Filtering - Add a simple panel of small buttons on the LHS of the Level View (TBD)
- HINTS (TBD)
- Layout Descriptions (To lend narrative to the story... "Evil Approaches..." .. "These are the blah blah blah of the evil blah blah blah"
- Categorize: Skills / Spells; Equipment; Consumables; Animations (TBD)

(BIG TBD's)
- Player Action: Can choose to block physical (strength based), or magical (intelligence based), or maybe even to "run away" by
- 				 granting you an extra portion of a turn. This would be instead of just attacking. (TBD)
- Religious Affiliation:  Add religious affiliation to Alteration - so that it can be blocked or manipulated. Example "Dark Magic": would
						  have Alteration.Affiliation = "Dark Magic", etc... Then, provide way to block spells based on religious affiliation.
						  Also, make skill learning based on affiliation.. or bonuses from defeating enemies based on affiliation.
						  
						  ***BETTER IDEA:  Have religious affiliation be per Character! Then, can alter behavior of combat (alterations and melee) 
							   			   based on religious affiliation. Example:  Player visits "Dark Shrine" .. Becomes 5% Satanic! So, when facing
										   Lynx (20% Light) takes more damage. So, would just have to calulate the difference based on level of
										   affiliation.
										   
										   BEST. ROGUE. IDEA. EVER. (probably not the first person to think so)
										   
										   Ideas:  Permanently alter character symbol based on level of affiliation :) :) :)
										   
												   Magic Block based on religious differences (thought this would be important to tune magic combat.. 
												   too much based on a single parameter)
												   
												   Probably don't want to replace attack attributes for balancing melee (keep simple).. But could
												   add some bonus damage or something.. probably better to have an affect; but keep it simple. Nothing
												   added to items for this... Except for increasing affiliation. So, would have to design a simple way
												   of doing this. May end up like attack attributes :(  Alot of little things to manage.
												   
												   Having several affiliations you'd want to choose based on "what it would do for me?" So say, "Druids"
												   have better use of food resources. Just add FoodUsagePerTurn -= 0.01 to the permanent affiliation to
												   increase "Druid + 5%".
												   
												   BALANCING IDEA: HAVE THESE BE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE :) Choosing one affiliation nullifies all others :)
												   PRESENTS A PROBLEM OF UNDO-ING ALL SPECIAL ATTRIBUTES INVOLVED WITH AFFILIATION. So, probably avoid
												   special attributes. Or, just store them like alterations that are removed from a list.
												   
										   Design: Add single collection of affiliations to the Alteration Effect. This would have to be updated like
												   attack attributes from the primary collection (Scenario -> General)
												   
										   IDEA:   Make the affiliation "Skill Building Affiliation"
										   
												   - Set of affiliations described by scenario-wide list:  Name, Short Description, Attribute Bonus
										   
												   - Each skill has affiliation (SkillBuildingAffiliation) with a symbol attached.
										   
												   - Affiliation generates skill points that can be used to advance skills of that affiliation
												   
												   - Affiliation can be enhanced (from 5% -> 10%) by using a doodad. 
												   
												   - Affiliations are mutually exclusive
												   
												   - Affiliation attribute bonuses are granted as passive alterations (so, aren't applied and removed)
												   
												   - Affiliation attribute bonuses are scaled by % of belief in that affiliation. (0 -> 1.00) * (bonus)
												   
												   - Skill points are accrued and applied when the player wishes to apply them.


- Alteration Effect: Add points to active skill (skill learning alteration effect) (TBD)
- Several Validation Points: 
	- Scenario Editor: Dungeon Template Name - UNIQUE and SET and NO FILE-NON-FRIENDLY CHARACTERS
	- Scenario: Player Name SET and UNIQUE and NO FILE-NON-FRIENDLY CHARACTERS
	- Scenario Files: Player Name + Scenario Name.. or put something in the header to show the scenario name also
- Scenario Editor: Fix up the Symbol Alteration logic for the UI. have to represent it properly for flags set.
- Dungeon Wide Events:  Alteration or note-bearing event that fires at random; or once during a specific level range. 
						- Example:  "Corruption" Adds to your player's "Corruption" level every 10,000 steps.. ish
						- Example:  "Turn back while you still can!" (from the big enemy of the scenario) (creates monster)
						- Example:  "Send player back to stairs up" :)  after X number of steps (pretty mean!)
						
- Boost Bar:  An extra boost to alterations or attack. This could be filled: On Step; On Enemy Death; On Attack. So, player 
			  can choose when to use their boost bar to add to the attack.			 

- Alteration:  Teleport within visible range or within range of X or something where enemies teleport near to the player's visible range

- Multi-Level Teleportation: Coordinated using multi-level layouts
- Tertiary Behavior

- Balancing (Paladin) - Add "teleport near (within attack range)" to Hell Hound (TBD)
- Balancing (Paladin) - Add "teleport adjacent" to teleport options (TBD)

- Layout Refactoring:

	- Goals:  Support for:
				- Random Room layouts
				- Intersecting rooms 
				- Maze rooms
				- Room inside a rooms
				- Boss levels (symmetric / static-ish layouts)
				- Hidden pathways: either hidden hallways randomly; hidden paths off the grid; or hidden paths between rooms
				- multiple halls between rooms
				- Big rooms specified by a clickable grid of rooms (specify which rooms are "grouped" in the room grid)
				- Add teleporters to any layout type
				- Points of interest (allows placing objective or unique content on those points)
				- Symmetric layouts
				- Specific shapes for layouts (pentagram, square thing, etc..)
				- Challenge levels (alternate stairwell for a challenge level)
				- Room levels without doors
				- Cell Fill color
				- Linear layouts v.s. non-linear (linear => start to end without options)
				- temporary walls (can demolish by walking through)
				- Switches and push blocks! (would use to open a door or let down a wall.. YEAh!)
				- Cellular Automata (with connected rooms with parameterized hallway thickness)
				- Room "Growing" - Start with a room, create a door or hall with random length. Then iterate to create the next room
				  or rooms (maybe 2 or 3)
				  
				- "Antfarm" procedure that uses random hall splitting (recursive)
				- Identify 'main room' or "first" and "last" rooms. Create connected rooms by showing they're connected to a single room
				  via some other room. First and Last rooms may have the stairwells.. So, could generate sequential "problem" set by having
				  conditions for advancement (beat a monster, find a key, etc..)
				- Monster generation per level (parameter) also, party room parameter
				
- Windows: Would treat like an open door that you can't pass through.. (But maybe could break)
				
- Zones:   Related to level layouts. 

		   - Idea: This would combine level content and layout generation
		   
		   - Goal: To separate the layout into "Zones" that are sequential. Each would have an "Exit Condition"
		   
				   - Step on a switch
				   - Defeat (All, Some, One of "These") enemies
				   - Collect Content
				   - Find a key

		   - Design Problem:  Have to build a layout based on a sequence of zones
		   
				   - ISSUE: CAN'T PERMIT "PITFALL" TYPE EFFECTS BECAUSE THEY BREAK SEQUENCE
				   - Can only allow linear progress through zones. CAN GO BACKWARD (RANDOM LEVEL UP) BUT NOT FORWARD (RANDOM LEVEL DOWN or PITFALL)
		   
		   - Idea: Description of zone problem built into scenario level zone template. 
		   
				   - Describes what to do for exit condition ALONG WITH story-line!
				   
					 GREAT. IDEA.
					 
					 Would allow for something like: "You're in King William's prison in the castle in Britain. You must find a 
													  way out of your cell.. Perhaps there's a secret passage nearby..."
													  
													  for the Level 1 template for zone 1! VERY. COOL.
													  
				   - This would give a LOT of power to the scenario by not only allowing for progressive rewards; but also accrued
					 descriptive - and totally configurable - storyline! :) :) VERY. VERY. GOOD.
					 
		   - Idea: Have a "Check Mark" box to show completion of objective(s) for current Level->Zone.
		   
		   - Side Objectives:  
		   
				   - These would be configured on the Zone object to allow the player to find some kind of other hidden
					 room, passage, etc... But essentially use the same engine to create the objective that would be used
					 for linear progression.
					 
						- Examples:  Switched door, hidden passage, keyed door, hidden cache (treasure chest), hidden room, etc...
						
				   - These would be optional so don't require explanation (text)
				
		   - Exit Conditions:  HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GO BACKWARDS.
		   
				   - Switch:  Two state doodad, Riddle Doodad, Temporary event, Weighted doodad
				   
						- Two State Doodad:  ON or OFF - icon for each state
						- Riddle Doodad:     Set the dials on the doodad to create a word to solve the riddle
						- Weighted Doodad:   Stepping on this triggers a "Zone Event" - which may be a timed event
											 
											 Idea:  Could use weight of items to weigh down the switch. So, would need
													weight parameter. Problem with overlapping weight of enemy, or flying enemy, etc...
													
											 Idea:  Push, Pull a block to set on the switch.
											 
											 Idea:  Create a push / pull block problem to solve (like seen in many games) to advance
													to the next zone.
													
										     Idea:  Have switches that you must UN-weight in order to open the door (Example: pedestal)
													
				   - Defeat Enemy(ies):  Have to defeat a speific, all, or one of ____ enemies to advance
				   - Collect Item(s):    Have to collect specific items to advance

									     Idea:  Create special item room with a "pedestal" or point of interest for an item.
										 
										 Idea:  Create item "room" with points of interest.. (something similar)
										 
				   - Collect Key:   Hide the key somewhere to collect. 
				   
									- Generate in enemy inventory (MANDATORY)
									- Generate in level (MANDATORY)
									- Generate in treasure chest cache (MANDATORY)
									- Generate in special item room (MANDATORY)
									
		   - Reversable:  MUST BE ABLE TO GO BACKWARDS
		   
						  - For switched doors, have to have a switch on the other side (INCLUDES SIDE OBJECTIVES)
						  - For content related doors (enemies, items) have to leave the door open
						  
				  
				
- Recipes: New consumable type that blends other misc consumables to create a new one

- Animation refactoring:  Support for...

		- Fading Chain (chain lightning)
		- Earthquake! (shaking screen)
		- "Jumps" (Character jumps .. like a prelude to an "Earthquake" skill or something)
		- Other shapes (square, rectangle, some, other, enumerated, types)
		- Easing functions
		- More interesting animations (ease out, come back, etc...)
		- Better language to describe more complex animations
		- Slow animation speeds relative to animation time
		- Criss Cross animation
		- Tracers!
		- Spiral inward
		
- Alteration Effect: Push Back Enemies ("X" number of spaces).. Possibly on a "Wave" with animations (but that's tricky)

- Teleportation:  Add a standard animation for teleporting that shows the trajectory of the path to the new location.						

- Character classes:  Add class selection and set for equipment. Provide choice at the beginning of class.
					 (Defined in Scenario): Example: Elf, Dwarf, Employee, Wizard, Worlock, etc... These would
					 have equipment trade-offs, combat implications, and attribute bonuses.
					 
					 Equipment: Have different patameter sets per class. OR just a flag to say "Out of class" or "In class"
								to make it simpler.
								
					 Idea:  Chose race (elf, golem, etc...); chose attack attribute bonus to start with. Race could make you 
					 immune to certain altered states.
					 
					 Also, could spend points at start instead of being assigned attribute values. So, need more intelligence,
					 and agility combat consequences.

				     Altered States:  Certain classes are immune from certain states. Example: Stone Golem immune from stone..

					 Enemy Classes:   Could support combat adjustment from interacting character classes. Example:  Stone Golem
									  has a multiplier v.s. Wizard and Worlock classes. Or, a "Miss Ratio" multiplier.. But these
									  would be set up in the Scenario Editor.. 

									  Setup:  Character Class "Elf": (contains) ClassAttribute, List<ClassAttributeMelee>
											  
											  ClassAttribute:  Any Player Stat (Strength, Agility, ..., Attack, Defense, Miss Ratio, Dodge, Critical Hit, etc...)
															   with a bonus. This would show up as a Passive Alteration. The effect could be positive or negative.

											  ClassAttributeChange = ClassAttribute (modification) + EnemyClassName

														       The effect of this would be to modify the player's stat (determined by the ClassAttribute)
															   during Melee combat ONLY.

															   WOULD REALLY WANT TO SHOW PEOPLE WHAT WAS HAPPENING HERE. So, extra combat messages are 
															   preferred to show.

															   Example:  "Stone Golem" is immune to Altered State = "Stone". His class attribute is
																	     + 0.3 for Critical Hit.

																		 Against Wizard:		    Class Attribute = -5 Intelligence
																		 Against Elf:			    Class Attribute = -3 Agility
																		 Against Water Elemental:   Class Attribute = -10 Defense
									
																	     Message (Water Elemental):  Leviathan attacked Ryan
																									 HP = 43 + Attack Attributes...
																									 Bonus attack for Water Elemental = 32

					 
- Weapons "Gain Experience" from defeating enemies. So, they would "grow" with your character. 

- Enemy Alteration Effect on being hit: Example: "Jelly" divides into two when hit.

- Enemy "Alteration": Riddle.... Example: The riddle of the sphinx. Alteration Effect applied if answered incorrectly (?) or correctly(?)
				
					  OR!  Just a riddle from a doodad - have one incorrect and one correct answer.
					  
					  So, would want to support RIDDLES!!!
					  
- Add - Electricity symbols.. things for lightning!

- ISSUE - Have to use engage radius as enemy "light radius". PROBLEM: HAVE TO FIX PERFORMANCE ISSUE OF MULTIPLE LIGHT RADII USING
		  WPF OPACITY MASKS. PLANNING TO TRY PAINTING ALL TO A SINGLE BITMAP AND THEN APPLYING THE OPACITY MASK ONCE.
						  
-  Add - "Scenario Oracle" - just an endless identify doodad at the end of each scenario to show the total % complete in the stats.
							 (OR) Just identify everything the player has found.
						  
- (TBD) Fade-in for opening animation; and on opening level (Also fade out when player death)					

- Icon sets: This is for randomizing item glyphs. So, probably apply to just items; but support List<SymbolDetails> for the template ONLY.

			 - Design Problem:  How to pick a random symbol from the set but keep it consistent for the rest of the scenario.
			 
- Player Stat:  Miss Ratio - BASED ON AGILITY and Equipment "Out of Class" flag. 
				
				Idea:   This stat would be factored in during combat. It would also be available for alterations
				
				Class:  Flag for equipment saying "Out of class" means that the item isn't meant to be used for that 
						character (bigger idea was class selection .. but it's not part of the game yet)
						
						So, this flag says whether or not the player has trouble wielding the weapon or piece of equipment.
						
				Effect: A simple melee calculation adjustment to factor in Miss Ratio (or Miss %).
				
				Idea:   Need way to communicate this to the user. Either we have a class specification for the player 
						on startup; and use this to specify all equipment classes.. 
						
						Example:  Scenario classes:  "Heavy Fighter", "Ranger", "Archer", "Pyro Ranger", etc...
						
								  Equipment "Fire Axe":  In Class for "Pyro Ranger", "Heavy Fighter", but Out of class for
														 "Archer", and "Ranger".
														 
								  Message to Fighter -> Ranger (class):  Equipped "Fire Axe", "Miss Ratio" Stat altered by -0.2
								  
						Simple Example:  NO Extra Classes
						
										 Equipment "Wizard Staff": Marked "Out of class" for the Fighter. So Miss Ratio altered by -0.3
								  
- Equip Messages:  Show stat changes when equipping.								  

- Player Stat Points:  AT THE BEGINNING - ALLOW USER TO SETUP PLAYER STATS USING POINT SYSTEM.

- WPF RENDER REFACTORING:  PERFORMANCE IS A PROBLEM. WANT TO TRY DRAWING THE PATH DATA TO A BITMAP BEFORE RENDERING TO TRY AND 
						   SPEED UP PERFORMANCE. IF IT WORKS - THEN GO FOR THE NEXT LAYER WHICH IS THE OPACITY.
						   
- Equipment Explainations: Add section to show parameter changes by %.

- Equipment Quality Enhancement:  Alteration to enhance quality value for equipment! Need to separate armor types
								  and weapon types just like for Enchant and Imbue.

								  Example:  Sharpening Stone - Upgrades Quality for weapons by 0.3! :)

								  Example:  Anvil - (would need ImageResources) Upgrades Quality for Armor by 0.3! :) :)

								  Name:  Maybe "Upgrade Weapon" and "Upgrade Armor"

- Player "Aura" Refactoring:  Several things...
		
		1) Separate Auras from Light Radius

		2) Use Aura Effect Range to create new aura on top of the light radius. 

		3) Choose whether to change Light Color or to apply Aura on top of Light Circle

		4) Show effect range in the Alterations screen.

		Effectively this should separate the two and show them independently
						  
- PLAYER DEATH R.I.P. TOMBSTONE

- Messages when objective has been acheived

---------
						  
- Add - Scenario details to Open screen
- Add - MP Low behavior
- Add - Message when saving game
- Add - Messages for spell alterations (melee messages)

- Change - Maze level "Dim Gray" to something brighter or colored (Firebrick Red)
- Change - Zealot skeleton animation to single blink
- Change - Remove "Mood" from player status and maybe add altered state "quick panel"

- ISSUE - "Standoffish" Can't calculate path to run away or open obstacles like doors
- ISSUE - Have to put in safety checks for completely filled level (Get Random Cell will crash)
- ISSUE - Teleporting enemies are still shown. Can see their new location
- ISSUE - Fix door issue (not opening; but open.. can't see through)
- ISSUE - "Blink" animations reveal the level size. Should turn those into blink for the full screen
- ISSUE - Have to turn off Skill on Skill level up!
- ISSUE - Uncurse pre-condition not calculated. Allowed casting of alteration (item grid). Also, "back" button on dialog was visible
- ISSUE - Pitfall STILL VISIBLE
- ISSUE - Add paging to ellipse panel
- ISSUE - Need way to systematize placing level content (on the backend). So, probably best to have the IModelService place ANY contents
		  So that it can always check for free cells to place content on. If there's no cell available - need to decide how to proceed.. may
		  be that the content is objective and therefore has to be placed.
- ISSUE - See Invisible isn't working.
- ISSUE - Reveal isn't showing invisible enemies
			  
- Fix - Spell max level didn't shut off learning. Also need to change UI to show max level; and display the skill set icon
- Fix - Skill learning didn't work when player learned skill AFTER required level
- Fix - Multi-use consumables not updated after use
- Fix - Problem with Blindness - didn't recalculate enemy visibility immediately
- Fix - Zealots didn't move around
- Fix - Enemy opens door - trigger topology change (something went wrong.. didn't show door opened)
- Fix - Unique text color in Rogue Encyclopedia
- Fix - Apply limits to MP (negative value on Lynx evaporate MP)
- Fix - Update player symbol when activating skill (should be done on turn)
- Fix - Add Attack Attribute melee message to player spell and enemy spell (meleetarget)
- Fix - Spiral Target with constant velocity animation caused crash "Trying to calculate const velocity for spiral animation"
- Fix - "Vile Mother has used 'Create Vile' on"
- Fix - Identify for non-class items should identify all future non-class items with the same RogueName
- Fix - Identify All isn't updating the Encyclopedia view
						
- Balancing (Paladin) - Add some skills for learning: Disciple, Satanic Priest, maybe one or two other.. but EViL! >_<

--------------

IMMEDIATE TODO'S:

	- Intelligence Scaled Alterations:  TotalValue = Value * (1 + Character.GetIntelligence()) applied to any alteration effect.		
	- Finish up Rogue Encyclopedia:  Implement paging, fix minor error with display (non-identified text, total progress, etc...)
	- Above Fix / ISSUE / Change / Add (NECESSARY ONLY)
