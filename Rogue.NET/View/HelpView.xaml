                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Answer:  Your player can die during combat from an enemy hit. You can also die from starvation, and magic effects from items that you either wear or use." />

                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Answer:  You'll want to monitor your player's HP carefully. If you see it starting to drop - be sure to see what's happening. You should be wary of any spells you cast, potions you drink, etc... You can monitor your player's stats in the player stats sub-panel on the right side of the screen." />

                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Question:  What is the Player sub-panel; and what are all those screens?" />
                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Answer:  There are several screens - Equipment, Consumables, Inventory, Skills, and Stats. The functions for each of these are at the top of the sub-panel. Equipment you equip, un-equip, or drop. Consumables you can consume, throw, or drop. Inventory allows you to see individual items and their properites before you drop them. Skills is a list of your player's learned skills; and Stats are your player's statistics and attack parameters." />

                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Question:  Uhh, most of those screens make sense.. why can't I throw my items. There's no buttons to press when I target an enemy?" />
                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Answer:  Only certain items are throwable. You'll have to see which ones you come across that are." />

                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Question:  I found a Cursed item!! What is THAT? And what do I do?" />
                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Answer:  Cursed items can only be removed once you've removed the curse. You'll have to find an item that removes curses. Once you've removed the curse - the evil magic SHOULD be removed also.... probably..." />

                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Question:  What are &quot;Attack Attributes&quot;?" />
                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Answer:  Glad you asked. These are special attributes that are carried by enemies, spells, and equipment. They're used during combat and normal play according to the following rules:" />

                    <TextBlock Margin="20, 8, 8, 8"
                           Text="           The resulting reduction in your HP = A * (1 - (R / (A + R))) = 2.45" />
                    <TextBlock Margin="20, 8, 8, 8"
                           Text="The attack (4.2A) from the enemy is blocked partially by a resistance (3R) from the player. So, the effect of Resistance is to block only a portion of the attack. The higher the resistance - the less of a blow the player will receive." />

                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Question:  Ok, I think I have an idea of what Attack Attributes are. They're a little complicated. What should I do?" />
                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Answer:  It's pretty simple. Just remember A = Attack, and R = Resistance. You'll want to build resistance against evil or enemy attributes; and find / exploit enemy weaknesses. This can mean the difference between winning and losing." />

                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Question:  What about enemy magic? How do I know if I'm being poisoned or something?" />
                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Answer:  Attack Attributes can vary for different scenarios. Each time your player's HP is altered - there should be a log message showing the calculation. Pay close attention to those messages to look for attack attribute related hits. Those could be hurting your player and you'll need to keep track of that." />

                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Question:  So I see Rogue.NET has a way to edit these Scenarios? How can I change the Fighter one?" />
                    <TextBlock Margin="8" Text="Answer:  There's 4 built-in Scenarios: Fighter, Paladin, Witch, and Sorcerer. These can be modified to player - but when you save them you'll be forced to re-name them. After saving your Scenario changes it will appear in the opening screen when beginning a new Scenario." />
